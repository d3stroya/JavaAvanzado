/**
 * Whe have an intelligent house with some devices:
 *  Lights
 *  Thermostat
 *  Radio
 * ...and some modes whiches change the state of devices.
 * 1) When entering home:
 *      hall and kitchen lights turn on
 *      radio turns on in a specific channel and volume
 *      thermostat turns on 22ยบ
 * 2) When going out:
 *      all devices turn off
 * 3) When we wake up:
 *      room1 light turns on with specific color and brigth
 *      thermostar turns on 20ยบ for 30 minutes
 *      radio turns on in a specific channel and volume
 *
 * So here, implementing facade pattern design, we create those 3 modes.
 * Then, we call them in Main and show each device with their attributes.
